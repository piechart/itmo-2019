- cats_direct is easier to read and understand even without annotated types. Clear logic, understandable parameters and their limitations => no questions what and how to test.
- assuming we have cats_direct in cats_composition used as a compiled module and we don't have an access to its source code, it becomes unclear how to test cats_composition since it only contains execution chain info, callers composition (cats_composition unexpectedly contains composition :o) and does now allow to understand the details of the functions used there - their behaviour, input and output. It is completely DI-built protocol-comparable class that only provides abstractions which can not (in this particular case) and should not be tested as units independently from the details.
- only poor output test of cats_composition was made
